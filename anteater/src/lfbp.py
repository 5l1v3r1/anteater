 MD4, MD5, single DES, RC4, or Dual_EC_DRBG

 The default project security mechanisms MUST NOT depend on cryptographic
 algorithms that are broken (e.g., MD4, MD5, single DES, RC4, or Dual_EC_DRBG).

The project security mechanisms SHOULD NOT by default depend on cryptographic
algorithms with known serious weaknesses (e.g., SHA-1).
